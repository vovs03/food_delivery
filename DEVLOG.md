### Columns

Columns
19:39
in future we'll draw this one and why i'm telling you this one because we want to put it
19:44
at the top so if i am able to put this row inside a column then it would put
19:51
the put everything the children try to put from the top okay
19:56
that's what i said earlier like this is using the top property but if i can put
20:03
the row inside a column then everything would be at the top at least it would start from the top and we
20:10
need that because as i said that in future we'll have more sections so what i'll do i'll go ahead and put
20:16
this two containers inside a column so hopefully it makes sense so i'll cut
20:22
this one and i'll put it inside a column and over here i'll have children and
20:28
i'll put it there now let's save it and now it's at the top so this is working as we expected
20:35
and according to the theory well now let's go ahead and create a margin for this container because it's too much at
20:42
the top so here we can set a margin property and over here we do edge
20:47
inserts only and here we do top say
20:53
45 and bottom say 15 now we'll save it and we'll see it came
20:59
down now over here they're too much this property is too much to the left
21:05
and too much to the right we can also help with this one now we do this one
21:10
inside the container so container itself from inside
21:17
inside the container will create empty space white space okay so
21:22
here i would use a padding and once again here inserts edge inserts only so would do
21:30
left say 20 and write say 20.
21:35
okay so it's already looking much better okay all right now while this this section will do a little
21:42
later over here we can put an icon over here well to do
21:47
that over here we can just simply use a child and we would use icon widget to do that
21:54
so icons dot search well i think before we go ahead i think we can import it okay this one
22:01
and then we'll use color so colors dot now this icon
22:08
package is uh part of the flatter so you don't need to import it okay all right
22:15
so now we'll go ahead and save it now we see it's right there okay
22:20
now to make sure that it's in the center we can just go ahead and simply wrap
